# Looper

You can configure which portal spawns after each main boss (Mithrix, Voidling, Twisted Scav) to keep the run going and specify a portal to spawn on each stage pre/post loop to orchestrate your runs. There's RiskOfOptions support so you can configure it in the game menu by going to "Settings" and "Mod Options".
Default Config:

	- Bazaar Portal after Mithrix
	- Bazaar Portal after Voidling
	- Bazaar Portal after Twisted Scavenger
	- No default stage portals
