# Looper

This mod adds portals that spawn after bosses allowing for infinite loops! The portals are configurable so you can spawn a specific portal instead of the default bazaar. You can also configure it to spawn a specific portal at a stage pre/post loop.
Default Config:
	- Bazaar Portal after Mithrix
	- Bazaar Portal after Voidling
	- Bazaar Portal after Twisted Scavenger

## Future Plans
* Ablity to configure in-game instead of the r2modman config editor.
* Add more portals at teleporter events
* Force portals at several stages in config
